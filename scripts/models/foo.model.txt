3) Run 'process_images.py' to pre-process training and validation images.
	a) We shouldn't have to change any parameters here.

4) Run 'train_model.py'.
	a) Adjust the variables at the top.
	b) This script saves the trained model in the 'models' folder.

5) Run 'classify.py' to classify new images from outside the training and validation sets.
	a) Set variables at the top.
	b) Alter code following model.predict() if necessary.
